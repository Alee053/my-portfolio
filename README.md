# Interactive Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, accessible at [www.alecastro.dev](https://www.alecastro.dev). This project was a deep dive into modern web technologies.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Complex Animations:** The homepage features a scroll-driven animation powered by GSAP that deconstructs the header text, and page elements animate into view.
* **Physics-Based Project Gallery:** On desktop, the projects section is a dynamic sandbox built with Matter.js, allowing users to interact with project blocks in a physics simulated environment.
* **Optimized Mobile Experience:** The projects section serves a completely different, lightweight list-based component for mobile users to ensure a fast and intuitive experience on all devices.
* **Headless Content Management:** All content, including blog posts and project details, is managed through Decap CMS, which commits changes directly to the GitHub repository.
* **Type-Safe Content:** Blog posts and projects are structured using Astro's Content Collections, providing type safety and validation for all data.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Both the blog and projects sections feature client-side filtering by tags and years.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built on the principle of using the right tool for the job, combining a static site generator with highly interactive client-side islands.

## Technical Highlights & Challenges

### Responsive Architecture: The Physics Engine Problem

Matter.js is resource-intensive and not well-suited for mobile touch interfaces. Instead of trying to force it to work, I implemented a responsive "switcher" component. This component detects the user's screen size and renders one of two completely different children:
* **`ProjectsDesktop.svelte`**: The full physics simulation.
* **`ProjectsMobile.svelte`**: A lightweight, performant grid view.

This ensures that no unnecessary JavaScript is loaded on mobile devices, leading to a much better user experience.

### Headless Workflow with Decap CMS

The entire content of the site is managed headlessly.
1.  I log in at `/admin`.
2.  I create or edit a blog post or project using the Decap CMS interface.
3.  Upon publishing, the CMS commits the new/updated `.md` or `.yml` file to the GitHub repository.
4.  This commit triggers an automatic rebuild and deployment on Vercel.

This workflow provides the benefits of a user-friendly CMS without the cost or maintenance of a traditional database and backend.
